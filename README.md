Data Structures in Python

These files contain practices I made when I was learning about the use of Python Data Structures, such as:
1. Lists
2. Dictionaries 
3. Tuples

There are some files where the user must type in the name of a .txt file to read and retrieve some information.
Those .py files were coded to identify specific information from specific files and will be useless wihout those files.
because those .txt files do not belong to me, I will not upload those files to my repository.

Thank you for taking a look into my repository!
